# Weekly Reflection Journal - Week 5

### Challenges Faced:

The most challenging topic this week was to understand the new hooks Reducer and Context in React. Honestly it was really difficult to grasp the concept, at least to me personally. I had to go back and forth between different sources and tutorials and explanations, but I couldn't say that I really got it. I understood useReducer to some extent, but context was still quite confusing. The class activities were a completely different story as I struggled quite a lot just to have something that somewhat works the way it's expected to.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

Compared to previous hooks, the road was quite bumpy this week with the new topics. In the end I think I've got something with the useReducer through examples and guided frontend activity 1-a. After that I spent a lot of time (on homework) just trying to do activity 1-b myself (the semi-guided one). I couldn't say that I succeeded at that, as I had to employ the help of ChatGPT in some parts.

- Key Learning:

What we've learnt this week: using reducer and context to scale up the app to manage multiple states.

- Online resources:

Resources continue from the React tutorial video and mostly react.dev website.

### Coping Strategies:

My strategy was to make sure I (somewhat) understand the example code, and then replicate it closely in the lab activities. It was not easy as they were not exactly similar and the labs only provided general instructions (frontend 1-b and project lab). I tried to look up explanations online and also from ChatGPT to compare the code.

### Project Management:

As we did not have class on Tuesday, the group had a little bit of time to reorganize our project works. It is actually really good that we're working on it continuously and making progress, and not waiting until the sprint deadline approaches to do something. However after Thursday class, we decided to spent time focusing on the class activities/individual weekly submission. New topics were hard for everyone, so we wanted to make sure that we understand the concept first before we can think of any ways to implement it into the project.

### Final Thoughts:

I like the approach for lab activities with different levels of instructions, so people can choose what works best for them and if they want to seek some challenges. Personally I would like to see some example solutions provided in the semi-guided labs. It can be external link leading to the solutions at the end of the page, so we can compare with our own solutions, and learn the best practice/leaner code from it.
