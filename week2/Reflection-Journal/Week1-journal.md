# Weekly Reflection Journal - Week 2

- Student Name: Pham Dang Dung
- Week 34: 28/8 - 3/9

Based on shorter version of the journal template.

### What have you learned this week?

The topics for this week were about JavaScript literals, objects and JSON, Express, HTTP and Middlewares for Backend, continuation with React, JavaScript methods/operators and the use of Postman for Frontend. Git branching and merging in project management were also discussed and we spent a considerable amount of time working on the first sprint deliverable.

### What were the most challenging topics?

I would say the most challenging topic for this week was to finalizing our work earlier into the first sprint for the group project. We had group meetings to work on the low-fidelity using Figma trying to come up with a decent and intuitive web page/layout. Additionally, another challenge personally was to trying to understand how to use React and Express in developing a web app compare to the primitive way of using basic HTML and JavaScript that we did in our first year.

### Describe your group's dynamics:

In my opinion the chemistry is really there in the group. Regardless of individual capabilities on technical terms, everyone was willing to contribute to our project work and tried to allocate personal time to join and help others with tasks. We decided on member roles in the project and no conflict arose.

Same as last week if I need to evaluate our group I would give 5 to everyone because of their dedication.

### Workload: How many times hours per week?

On average I spent around 6-7 hours a day on the course work and related topics, probably more on days when I didn't have work and less when I did.

### Any suggestions?

I like the introduction of the question banks and would love to see it updated frequently with new topics learnt so we would have some ideas of what we will have in the exam.
