# Weekly Reflection Journal - Week 1

- Student Name: Pham Dang Dung
- Week 34: 21/8 - 27/8

### Challenges Faced:

The biggest challenge posed by the first week of study to me personally was to try to refresh all the knowledge acquired during the first year. I spent quite a lot of time just to remember and review the logic and syntax of coding language. Time management was also a challenge, especially after the summer break, as I had to create and revise a study plane suitable to the course and personal/work schedule.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

I was able to follow the instructions in the activities and compare the results of the lab with what provided, so that everything ran properly on my machine. In my opinion the key is to read carefully every line of code and instruction so that you can fix some basic error that could lead to the code not working, most of the time it could just be typing errors/typos, or mismatchings between the example code and the activity's instruction.

- Key Learning:

We got introduced to Node.js and had some refresh labs for JavaScript for Backend and basics of React for Frontend. The Project lectures came with many new concept (for me) about software development project management and useful tools for it (npm, GitHub, Scrum method, Figma for interface design).

- Online Resources:

I watched teacher's recommended videos and tried to follow links to external sources in the activities. Additionally I did some googling to find explanation online for concept/code that I didn't understand.

### Personal and Group Progress:

- Personal Progress:

I would say that my study went smoothly, at least for the first week, albeit rather slowly. I tried to complete all the activities during or right after lecture classes, and spent free days to review the labs and read through online article/discussion about the code/concept. On average at least 6 hours per day were spent for the study.

- Group Dynamics and Project Progress:

We formed a group for the project and my first impression was that everybody was nice and very helpful to each other. We did the activity labs on our own on our machine but every time one needed help others offer assistance immediately. We also had our first online meeting outside of class hours to discuss about the project.

I would give 5 to all group members based on their enthusiasm and friendliness.

### Feedback

I really liked the extensive online source provided by the teacher, many of them are tutorials and crashcourse video so I don't feel completely lost when learning new tools/concepts. I would like to have a bit more of practicing exercises with solutions like in the JavaScript arrow functions lab so we can brainstorm coding.
