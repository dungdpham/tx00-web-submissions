# Weekly Reflection Journal - Week 4

- Student Name: Pham Dang Dung
- Week 37: 11/9 - 17/9

### Challenges Faced:

Almost all challenges faced this week revolved around the project sprint for me and the group. The project works felt a little bit overwhelming to us as we were not really confident about our knowledge yet and had to make the app really ours from the demo provided by the teacher. Elsewhere, the lesson with useEffect hook confused me as well so I spent some time to read through online sources explaining in details about JavaScript hooks.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

The lessons for both frontend and backend went quite smoothly as, at this stage in the course, I could understand most of the code. However, it still took some time for me to understand how frontend and backend communicates with each other and what happens behind the scene at each side: server and user's browser. I actually had to ask ChatGPT in a rather long session to gain some insight into this.

- Key Learning:

What we've learnt this week: using database to store data remotely and implementing it on the backend API server, useEffect hook and React forms. I also tried to include the error handler and try...catch in asynchronous functions in the labs.

- Online resources:

Online resourses for this week included recommended videos by the teacher as usual. Other sources that I relied a lot on for my work were ChatGPT and tutorials on Youtube about building e-commerce webapp using MERN stack, as it's what we are doing for our group project.

### Coping Strategies:

We spent a lot of time together as a group to use provided resources to make the project happens i.e. modifying the teacher's demo to use it in our sprint. Communication was key this week as we felt necessary to collaborate with others so everyone would be on the same page.

### Project Management:

The sprint works were a little hectic at first as we didn't really know what we could do by ourselves and which part/component of the sprint that we could contribute to. Things eased out as time went and we tried to cover the part where others had trouble with. Group dynamic was really good between members and we always encourage others to keep coding.

Another 5 for my group: even though sadly, by the time of writing this journal, we haven't suceeded with the 2nd sprint yet, but it's really apparent that everyone was trying their bests to participate in the sprint work. We worked until lates in several nights and kept others updated with what we've figured out.

### Final Thoughts:

I really liked the activities this week where the whole class worked together on the labs with supervision/instructions from the teacher. It was really interesting to hear advices from many classmates about how they're coping with the course and I feel really thankful that the teacher understand our struggles in this.
