# Weekly Reflection Journal - Week 3

- Student Name: Pham Dang Dung
- Week 36: 04/9 - 10/9

### Challenges Faced:

The main challenge faced this week was that I started to complete some lab activities by myself. That is not to say that I didn't take a peak at the step-by-step activity instructions, however it served mainly as debugging to see where my own code went wrong. This also exposed parts of the course's knowledge I'm still lacking to date, namely frontend/react.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

Frontend lab activities went rather well as I managed to finished and understood a majority of the methods and development steps. JavaScript promise/async, await was also one the key learnings we got during the first year so I was able to comprehend most of the materials.

- Key Learning:

Key learnings for this week included: working with Express.js Routers and Controllers for Backend; React Events and Routers, useState Hooks for Frontend; Model-View-Controller (MVC) design, JavaScript Event Loop and Asynchronous programming.

- Online resources:

Online recourses that I went through this week consisted of tutorial videos and articles recommended by the teacher. For specific errors encountered during the lab activities and difficulties with understanding new concepts, I also did some light research (e.g. Googling) on websites like w3schools, stackoverflow, MDN web doc, etc.

### Coping Strategies:

The only strategy I would think of during this week was to spend quite a lot of time reading through materials (both the ones provided by the course and external sources online) and practicing coding.

### Project Management:

We had yet another online meeting in addition to group activities during class hours to discuss personal as well as project progress. After watching the presentations from other groups about their project ideas/first sprint, it was unanimous among group members that we need to improve our own project's web app layout and/or functionalities. One bigger concern was how we could prepare for the next sprint, as we felt with what we've learnt so far it would pose a challenge to deliver it on time by the end of next week.

For the participation of the group members both in individual tasks and project progress I would still give everyone a grade 5 for this week.

### Final Thoughts:

I appreciated how the teacher preparing both versions of lab activities (step-by-step and without code examples) for students with different preferences. As for the project deliverables, I couldn't help but think that with the progress of the course going on right now, it's quite difficult to complete the sprints by set deadlines. We have 2 weeks to deliver each sprint, but usually by the end of the first week we don't have enough knowledge from the classes to do it, so after we acquire needed concepts during the second week, this means we don't have much time left to complete it.
