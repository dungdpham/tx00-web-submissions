# Weekly Reflection Journal - Week 3

- Student Name: Pham Dang Dung
- Week 39: 25/9 - 01/10

### Challenges Faced:

Chalenges for this week study came mainly in the form of pair programming session during Tuesday class. The pair partner was randomly chosen so there was no guarantee before hand that we would be at the same level and understand the concept the same way. Another aspect was that I was afraid that we wouldn't be able to finish the task in time as the requirements looked quite imposing.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

The backend class in the morning session went rather well as the concept of authorization and web token weren't too difficult to grasp and the coding part was quite simple. Additionally, in contrary to my worries before the afternoon class, the pair programming session proceeded smoothly. My partner was really calm and knowledgeable and he did a good job as a navigator. I was able to learn a lot from him.

- Key Learning:

Key learnings this week: user authorization on backend server and signing and verifying web token; also how to work and develop the code/app in pair with clear roles: navigator and coder.

- Online resources:

Online video tutorials and other sources, as well as provided demo by the teacher on github.

### Coping Strategies:

My strategies were to follow the demo code closely and try to recycle what I understood and could use from it to my own labs. For pair-programming: trust and follow the navigator, but also suggest modification on parts that I thought could be improved.

### Project Management:

The group understood really well this week topic so we tried to implement the backend part immediately to the course project. However we also took our time on our own to study again last week frontend topics (React hooks, reducer and context) as we all had troubles with understanding their uses and implementation.

### Final Thoughts:

I quite liked the pair programming session and it went better than I expected. We were able to finish the main functionalities of the API in time, but still needed more time after the class to do additional requirements.
