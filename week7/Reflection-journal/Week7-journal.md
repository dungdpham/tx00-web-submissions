# Weekly Reflection Journal - Week 3

- Student Name: Pham Dang Dung
- Week 40: 02/10 - 08/10

### Challenges Faced:

Due to moving and work schedules, biggest challenge this week for me was to find time for the study and practices. That's not to say that I did not face any problems with the lesson topics, but I gladly got help and support from my group.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

Pair programming labs did not feel too intimidating as I thought before the sessions, as it looked like a bigger task of what we'd already done in the morning classes. Once our pair realized this, it made things a little bit easier as we knew the direction we should go for to complete the task.

- Key Learning:

Key learnings this week: custom hooks in frontend and backend API testing.

- Online resources:

Online video tutorials and other sources.

### Coping Strategies:

As mentioned above, mainly because of the move, I was lagged behind a little bit at the beginning of the week unable to participate fully in the class. I tried to compensate for it by spending almost whole weekend practicing and finishing up the labs. I also asked my group for explanation of the topics that I missed.

### Project Management:

As the deadline for the last 2 sprints approaches, we tried to speed up with our project and decided on what we should focus on finishing and what should be optional for if only we have time. The project is not an easy task for us, and it is challenging to apply what we've learnt from the course to the project. Result is that it seems like the project will turn out not exactly what we envisioned it to be at the beginning of the course.

### Final Thoughts:

This week was quite chaotic for me personally, and I really appriciated the understanding from the teacher and my group. I also hope we'd get to see the project from last year to know what the expectation is.
