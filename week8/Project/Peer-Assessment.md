# Peer Assessment

## Group 7 - SuomiSprint

- Grade: 5
- Members: Anna Linden, Arman Yerkeshev, Mamita Gurung, Trang Vu
- Very well prepared presentation. It was easy to notice that they spent a lot of time on the presentation preparation and the project it self. The presentation covered everything from the first sprint in Figma till deploytment. Very smooth transition and part division among team members. The project deployment also worked well.

## Group 12 - Renteez

- Grade: 5
- Members: Yadullah, Mohammed, Agrin, Theo
- Well done project. They included most of the things needed for a project of this idea (property webapp): all the suitable filters that you could find on a proper property listing website. Also well presented in front of the class.

## Group1 - Workout Manager

- Grade: 5
- Members: Deshko Andrii, Dias Soares Sérgio, Vuorinen Elias & Veikko Pelkonen
- The idea is simple but the execution is almost perfect. Contents of the website were also real contents from external API. I personally liked the image with linked body part. Intuitive design and also worked mobile first.

## Group 4 - Task Manager

- Grade: 5
- Members: Amir, KHAI, Berhanu, Kiana
- Nice UI, good presentation. Could use a little bit more of graphics on the website. I really liked their effort made during the course: they tried to study and work together in person in campus to ensure quality contribution, which was not really common to see.

## Group 2- Areena Booking

- Grade: 5
- Members: Himanshu Hooda, Siddarth Singotam, Bijay Karki, Vladislav Zakatov
- Another good presentation, project covered most needed functionality for a booking site. UI can be polished a little more. Also might use some picture for added appeal. Nevertheless I appreciated their effort finishing the project despite switching the idea midway.

## Group 3 - Wristwatch Marketplace

- Grade: 5
- Members: Keti Mandunga, Akseli Kaarre, Miro Saarinen & Jesper Selenius
- Nice original idea, at least among peers within this course. I like the project idea and the website layout. They surely knew what functions to include in a marketplace type of website. Put a lot of emphasis to ensure the webapp works on mobile devices as well.

## Group 5, Weather App

- Grade: 5
- Members: Antti Kukkonen, Iikka Malmi, Jommi Koljonen, Taavi Nätynki
- Simple idea done well. Main UI looked good for a weather app, that covered needed information without being to crowded. Also really good implementation of concepts learnt in classes into 'favorites' functionality for saved locations.

## Group 9 : Barber Shop Listing

- Grade: 5
- Members: Hafiz, Anish
- Simple website with only necessary functions but I appreciated their effort spent with only 2 members in the group.

## Group 10: Peetu: journey API

- Grade: 5
- Member: Peetu
- Can't say that I understood everything but really impressive work considering he worked alone. Looks simple but actually quite a big task.
